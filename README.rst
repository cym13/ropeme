Ropeme: a ROP exploitation tutorial
===================================

Ropeme is a set of exercises and a test program to learn about exploitation
using ROP techniques. In order not to spoil the pleasure, the program's
sources code is encoded in base64. You can look at it if you want but I
reccommend not to do so before completing the exercises. If you want to
recompile it with different options you can modify thoses in the Makefile.

The exercises are naturally in `exercises.rst' while `writeup.rst' contains
a detailed solution to the problems.

This is meant to be used with linux. If you don't know what to use, you may
want to check up on the radare2 toolset.
